<h1>Note:</h1>

The transcripts in this directory were originally collected and analysed by Galati & Brennan (2010).

<h2>This directory contains:</h2>

- The Roadrunner-Hedge corpus (63 individual files in which 3 triads narrative a Roadrunner cartoon three times to addressees). Each line, which constitutes a narrative element, is annotated for the hedges that occur in that line.
- The HedgeCodebook denotes the annotation scheme used in our work.
- The RoadrunnerOnefile.csv is the entire corpus collapsed into one .csv file.
