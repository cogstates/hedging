10,1,1,"New","okay how am I gonna get the roadrunner ?",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","so the area the area that they’re in",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","is really like mountainous ?",NA,"like","?","10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and there’s lots of cliffs ?",NA,NA,"?","10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","soo thee coyote",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","hee goes up to an area where he’s on an edge of a cliff",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","aand then there’s like a space",NA,"like",NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and then there’s a cliff on the other side",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","like in front of him ?","uh-huh","like","?","10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and between them down below",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","there’s a path where the roadrunner is gonna run ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","so what the coyote does is",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","he puts um like a rope",NA,"like",NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","um attaching both cliffs ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and then he gets an anvil",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and he w he starts to walk across the rope",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","with the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","aand but the rope bends down so low",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","that he he’s practically on the ground",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","so when the",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","when the roadrunner comes up to him",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","he sees the coyote with the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and he just turns around",NA,"just",NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and he’s so fast that",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","thee coyote didn’t have time to drop the anvil on",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","the roadrunner ?","mm-hmm mm-hmm",NA,"?","10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","so when he dropped it",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","he missed the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and when he dropped the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","he shot back up into the air",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","because he didn’t have weight holding him down anymore ?","mm-hmm mm-hmm",NA,"?","10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","so he sh he shot back up into the air",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and then he was wearing a book bag",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","um it was supposed to be a parachute",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","so he pulled the string of his parachute",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and everything came out of his book bag",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","but there was no parachute",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","there was no like balloon part",NA,"like",NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","so he just ends up falling to the ground",NA,"just",NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and then he sees the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","uh run into a mine",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","so he follows the roadrunner into the mine",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and they’re going in circles for a bit",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and then um there’s",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","after they go in circles there’s kind of a zigzag pa",NA,"kind of",NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","zigzag path ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and the coyote is still following the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and at the end of the zigzag path",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","there it um it ends in like",NA,"like",NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","it splits? into two paths ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?, ?","10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and the roadrunner takes the top path",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and the coyote takes the bottom path",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and so the the coyote’s going along the bottom path",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and then it gets really dark and he can’t see anymore","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","so he lights a match",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","so he could see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","aand then you see him sitting there with the match",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and there’s like a whole bunch of TNT around him ?",NA,"like","?","10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","so then that explodes and that’s the end of him",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and then um you see above the ground",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","it says YIPE ?",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,1,1,"New","and then that’s it",NA,NA,NA,"10-1-1-New"
10,2,1,"Old","okay so",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","the coyote is going after the roadrunner ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","aand the coyote is wearing a bib",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","and holding a knife and a fork",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","aand he’s he’s running after the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","and he lunges forward to try and get him",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","but he misses",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","’cause the roadrunner is too fast ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","and he just takes off",NA,"just",NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","so now the coyote is thinking",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","okay how am I gonna get this roadrunner ? ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","soo he knows the roadrunner’s path",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","where he’s running ?",NA,NA,"?","10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","so he goes to a cliff",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","that’s above the roadrunner’s path ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","aand he ties a rope from that cliff",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","to thee cliff like a cross thee road ?",NA,"like","?","10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","aand then he gets an anvil ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","and h he walks across the rope with the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","aand the um ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","because the anvil is so heavy ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","uh he starts to like go down to the ground",NA,"like",NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","on the rope",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","aand when thee roadrunner comes on the path ? ",NA,NA,"?","10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","where the coyote is ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","um the coyote is too slow ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","to like throw thee anvil on him ?",NA,"like","?","10-2-1-Old"

10,2,1,"Old","and goes back ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","and then when thee coyote finally ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","throws the anvil and misses the roadrunner ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","hee gets uh like popped up into the air",NA,"like",NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","by thee rope ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"

10,2,1,"Old","they’re just going in circles ",NA,"just",NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","and then they get to a zigzag path",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","so he’s still following him in the zigzag path ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","and then the zigzag path ends ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","it splits into two paths ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","and the roadrunner takes the top path ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","and thee coyote takes the bottom path",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","aand the bottom path gets very dark soo",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","the coyote lights a match ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"

10,2,1,"Old","and since he lit a match it explodes",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,2,1,"Old","and then on the screen it said it says YIPES  ",NA,NA,NA,"10-2-1-Old"
10,3,2,"New","okay so this is aa cartoon",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","about the roadrunner and the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"

10,3,2,"New","and holding a knife and a fork",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and he lunges to catch the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","but he misses",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","so he’s thinking",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","okay how am I gonna get this roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","soo hee goes to a cliff",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","aand he sees that down below is the roadrunner’s path",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","sso he gets an anvil",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and he thinks that",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","when the roadrunner passes by",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","he’ll throw the anvil on the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and he’llbe dead or whatever",NA,"or whatever",NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and so um",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","so he also attaches a rope to the cliff that he’s on",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and then there’s a cliff on the other side",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","of the roadrunner’s path ?",NA,NA,"?","10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","so attaches the rope to the other side of the cliff",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and then he starts to walk across the rope",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","holding the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and since the anvil is so heavy",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","it brings him down",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","the rope stretches ? pretty much to the ground ?",NA,NA,"?, ?","10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and when the roadrunner comes by",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","the coyote isn’t fast enough",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","to throw the anvil on the roadrunner ?",NA,NA,"?","10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","so the roadrunner just like he comes up to the coyote",NA,"just, like",NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and then just turns around and leaves",NA,"just",NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","’cause he’s so fast",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","so when the coyote throws the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and misses the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","the coyote who’s still on the rope",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","he got shot up into the air",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and then he has a book bag on his back",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"

10,3,2,"New","except the parachute balloon ?",NA,NA,"?","10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","so then he falls to the ground",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and then he sees the roadrunner run into a mine",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and so he’s kinda chasing the roadrunner",NA,"kinda",NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","around the mine going in circles",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and then they get to a zigzag path",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","so they go through the zigzag path",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and then it ends",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and it switches into two paths",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and the roadrunner takes the higher path",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and the coyote takes the lower path",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and then the lower part gets really dark",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","so the coyote lights a match",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and then you can see that there’s a whole bunch of TNT around him",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and then it explodes",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
10,3,2,"New","and then the last like picture on the screen it says YIPES",NA,"like",NA,"10-3-2-New"
11,1,1,"New","so this is a videoclip from the cartoon",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","the famous cartoon coyote and roadrunner ?",NA,NA,"?","11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","it comes with bugs bunny ?",NA,NA,"?","11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and so it starts off with uh",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","coyote as usual is chasing uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and he has like a bib on",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and a knife and a fork",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and he’s running after him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and they pause roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and they actually write his name roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and they write his latin na name",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","like acceleratis something",NA,"like, something",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","aand then they s pause coyote in the air",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and they write you know coyote",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and carnivoris vulgaris or something",NA,"or something",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and so then they continue with that",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and roadrunner starts off walking slowly",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","like an airplane about to lift off",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and so it starts",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","he starts running",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and it goes speed",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and becomes a blur of colors",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and coyote starts chasing after him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so then just to mock coyote uh",NA,"just",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","roadrunner stops in the air",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and just turns around",NA,"just",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and does his you know BEEP BEEP",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and so then coyote thinks",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","oh it’s my chance",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he pounces on him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","but roadrunner runs away by then",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and he falls",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","coyote falls to the ground",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and his knife and his fork get stuck on the road",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he falls down",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and makes a really sad angry face",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and then he brightens up again",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","’cause he has an idea",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so what he does is",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","he attaches a punch that has like a spring behind it ?",NA,"like","?","11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","you know those punches that come out like that",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","aand he attaches a string to the spring",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and ties it to a rock",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he has it ready",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and stands behind the rock",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he when he lets go of the spring",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","it’s gonna bounce at coyo uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"

11,1,1,"New","and he hears thee BEEP BEEP you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","that roadru roadrunner does all the time",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and then uh he releases the string",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","but it",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","contrary to what should happen",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","the rock pushes him back",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","instead of the punch pushing forward",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","the rock pushes back",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and crashes coyote between the mountain and the rock",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and then the punch also comes right back at him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and punches him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so then you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","coyote is now really angry",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he comes up with aa three step plan",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","aand one is that he’s gonna get a big weight of",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","a ton of weight or something?",NA,"or something","?","11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and he ties a rope from one end of the mou uh mountain",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","to another end",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so there’s a valley down below",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and he decides he’s gonna take that ton of weight",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and walk across the string",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","aand just right",NA,"just",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","right when he sees the roadrunner passing by",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","he’s gonna drop the ton of weight on top of roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he picks up the weight",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","starts walking across",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","but it’s so heavy",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","that the rope starts coming down all the way into the valley",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he’s on the ground",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so by the time he’s on the ground",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and he’s I don’t know",NA,"I don't know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","he’s about to think about what to do",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and roadrunner comes in",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","mocks him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","like ticks sticks his tongue out at coyote",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and then coyote gets so angry",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","he drops the weight",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","’cause I guess he’s gonna run after him or hit him",NA,"I guess",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","but because he drops the weight",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","he gets pushed bounced all the way up by the string",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he’s like flying in the air",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and then he pats his back",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","because he has a bag",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he’s like oh I got a parachute",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","he doesn’t say anything obviously",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","but you know that’s what we think",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he pulls the string",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","the bag opens",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","but all of these things come out of the bag",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","like bowls and hats or something",NA,"like, or something",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","but it’s no there’s no parachute there",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so then he’s like ah that’s it",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he takes out a box of uh aspirin ?",NA,NA,"?","11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","takes them",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and then says goodbye",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and falls down",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","then somehow as usual in the cartoons",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","he’s alive again",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and um he comes up",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","he starts chasing uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","aand they go into this uh cave",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","which is called a pine cave pine mine or something uh",NA,"or something",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","cactus mine",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","aand they start running",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","bec but but he",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","as he’s running",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","coyote’s chasing after uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","after a little while it becomes really dark in there",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he turns back around",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","gets those construction hats",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","with the lights on top",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","aand while he’s putting that on",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","roadrunner comes back up behind him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and says BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","because he’s already had his hat on",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so coyote’s still like engulfed in just trying to catch roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","that he doesn’t even know what’s going on",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he starts running after him with the cap",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and it’s like a maze of tunnels",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so it’s like a square first",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and they keep going around and around and around",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and then coyote goes off to the left",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and waits",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and coyo uh",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","roadrunner goes off to the left",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","another tunnel like this",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","waits there",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","while coyote keeps going around and around and around",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and then roadrunner BEEP BEEPed",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and says BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and then coyote’s like oh he’s over there",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he starts running after him again",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and then they get to this tunn uh elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","okay so roadrunner goes into the elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","it’s like an open elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","it’s one of those bases with strings attached",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","like a pulley kind of",NA,"like, kind of",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so roadrunner steps onto that",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and so he goes down",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so coyote is like you know I have to go chase after him",NA,"like, youknow",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he sees another uh elevator kind of thing",NA,"kind of, thing",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so coyote goes into that one",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","but then what happens is because he goes into that one",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","he goes up and uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","he goes down and roadrunner comes back up",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","because it’s they’re attached","right",NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","you know the pulley system",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so they get off",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","roadrunner get gets off the elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and then coyote follows him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and they go into another tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so it’s like the mine",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","but they make it a flat map",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","okay ?",NA,NA,"?","11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","where there’s a square tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so they get to the tunnel that’s a zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","it goes up and down up and down up and down",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so coyo roadrunner starts going in that tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so coyote chases after him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","then the uh zigzag ends at this place",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","where there’s like fork",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","okay a Y",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","one branch goes up there",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and one keeps going straight",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so roadrunner quickly goes to that branch",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","while coyote keeps going straight",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and there’s none",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","before they were in the zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","like up and down up and down",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and now it’s just a straight flat thing",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","but coyote keeps going up and down as if it’s aa zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so he keeps bumping up on the ceiling",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","then against the wall",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","then the ceiling then against the wall",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","until his light bursts",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and so then he’s like you have to do something",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","you can’t see anything",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and so he lights a match",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and right next to him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","there’s a  huge room filled with TNT boxes",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","so then it explodes",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","and it says YIPES",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,1,1,"New","that’s basically it",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
11,2,1,"Old","okay so",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","this is the cartoon of roadrunner and coyote",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","aand you know it’s that famous cartoon",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","that comes with bugs bunny",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and so what happens is",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","they start off showing",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","coyote chasing roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and roadrunner is running and running",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so they pause him in the air",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","just to introduce him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","like as a main character",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and so they write roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and they write a latin name for him too",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","like accelerat-tis something",NA,"like, something",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","or it’s not true latin",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","it’s just a play on words",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and then sthey they then go",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and then they focus on coyote",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and they pause on him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and they say",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","they write his name coyote",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and then they write carnivoris vulgaris",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","or something same thing again",NA,"or something",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","in latin but play on words",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and they show coyote has a bib on",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and has a fork and a knife",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and he’s ready to just like",NA,"just, like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","eat up the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so roadrunner’s",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","they sh",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","then they go back",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","they restart the scene you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","they’re pausing it",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","they started again",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","aand roadrunner starts running slowly slowly",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","as if he’s about to lift off like an airplane ?",NA,NA,"?","11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and then as he’s going he says BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and then starts going faster",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and so then they show you know kind of a blur of colors",NA,"you know, kind of",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","you know red and blue",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and then coyote starts chasing after him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","you know keeps going",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","sspeeds up himself as well",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and roadrunner then all of a sudden",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","like bounces in the air",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","it’s a short pause in the air",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","like it pauses a short while",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","it turns around and says BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","mocks him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and so coyote is like jumps on him",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","just about to get him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","but he falls",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","his knife and his fork fall to the ground",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and then you see",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he’s stuck in the ground",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so he falls down",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and gets really angry",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","puts his hand on his chin",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and then after that hee",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","all of a sudden becomes happy again",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","because he thinks of an idea",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","okay",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so what he does is",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he gets the wa punch",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","those punches that are attached to the springs ?",NA,NA,"?","11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","aand he attaches that with the string to a rock",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","okay and he’s going to release it",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","you know like",NA,"you know, like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","using the action reaction physics stuff",NA,"stuff",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so then what happens is uh",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he gets ready he ties the thing to a rock",NA,"the thing",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","the spring and the string to a rock",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and stands behind the rock",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and he’s listening",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","waiting for coyote",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so we hear coyote uh",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","listening and waiting for roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and we have roadrunner uh you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","going zooming really fast",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","okay",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so coyote at that moment releases the punch",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","but instead of the punch going forward",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","like hitting uh roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","the rock gets pushed back",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and smashes uh coyote",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","between the rock itself from the mountain",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and so then what happens is",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","not only does the rock go back",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","but the punch turns around and punches coyote",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so he gets hit twice",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so then he’s like okay",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","then he comes up with a three step plan",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","they show a paper",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","a blue paper where he has written it down",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","aand what he does is",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he has a string of a tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","attached from one mountain to the other",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and there’s a valley down there",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","where he knows that roadrunner’s gonna run through",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and he brings this big ton of weight",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","that he’s gonna cr carry across the rope",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and wait at the center",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and then coyo uh roadrunner passes by",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he’s gonna drop the weight on roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and smash him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and get rid of him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so what happens is",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","as he’s kind of walking the rope",NA,"kind of",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","the weight is so heavy",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","that the whole rope starts bending down",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so it’s attached to the mountain",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","but in the center he’s bending down",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so he f stands",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he’s basically standing on the rope",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so roadrunner comes up to him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and says BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","sticks his tongue out at him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and mocks him you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","like you’re gonna do what I thought here",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so coyote then gets really upset",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so he puts the weight down",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","throws the weight down",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","but when he does that",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he’s he bounces up",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","you know the weight push",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","the tightrope pushes him back up into the air",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and as he’s going",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he then pats his shoulder",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and says ah I have my bag",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he doesn’t say anythiing",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","but you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","pats his shoulder",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and we see a bag a green bag behind him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and then he’s pulled a string",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","but instead of a parachute coming out",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","a lot of stuff comes out",NA,"stuff",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","like a bowl a hat or something",NA,"like, or something",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and so then he starts falling down",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so then what he does is",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he takes a box of aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","takes it",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","says goodbye and falls down",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","okay",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so then after that",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","yeah like in cartoons",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he magically becomes alive again",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and then he goes uh",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","starts chasing roadrunner again",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","aand roadrunner runs into a cactus mine",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","like a mine you know",NA,"like, you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","a cave and tunnels",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so coyote starts chasing after him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and after a few you know feet",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","they get he coyote hits darkness",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","there’s no light",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so he turns back around",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","goes gets a cap",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","a construction hat that has a light on him on it",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","aand uh roadrunner comes up",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","right behind",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he has already taken the hat",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he’s all ready",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so he says BEEP BEEP again",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and so coyote gets even more angry",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so he puts on the hat",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","starts chasing coyo uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so then roadrunner ends up going you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","round and round in one square",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","they make",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","instead of showing the cave",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","they show a flat map of the cave",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and they make green and red dots",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","for red dot is for coyote and green dot is for roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","aand so what happens is uh",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","coyote starts chasing roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so first roadrunner follows a basic square pattern",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he keeps going s in the square",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","like from here to here to here to here",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and after a while",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","coyote thinks he just continues to go like that",NA,"just",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and roadrunner steps off to the side",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and just coyote keeps going like that",NA,"just",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","even though roadrunner is already on the other side",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so then roadrunner says BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and coyote turns back around",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and sees him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and so chases him again",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and this time",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","uh they flip it back to the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and roadrunner steps onto an elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","you know like a flat platform with a chain attached to the top",NA,"you know, like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","aand he goes down",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and so then coyote sees that there’s another elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","right next to it",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so he steps into that",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and when he goes down the elevator comes back up",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","the roadrunner comes back up",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so then after a while he comes back",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and he starts chasing him again",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and roadrunner runs into a tunnel that’s zig",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","it’s going up and down like a zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","if you look at it in a flat way",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","aand so it keeps going",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and coyote starts chasing after him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","keeps going keeps going",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so then at the end of the zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","there’s a fork or a Y",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","one f side goes up",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and one keeps going straight",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","without a zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","like a flat area",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so roadrunner goes up to the top branch",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and uh it’s coyote goes to the bottom branch",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","but he doesn’t notice that",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","it’s not going up and down anymore",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","just a straight flat thing",NA,"thing",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and he keeps bouncing up and down up and down",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","until you know his hat",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","so he keeps bumping up into the ceiling",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and then down onto the floor",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and the light on his cap just bursts",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and you know it goes out",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and so then he lands in this big room",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","he lights a match",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and all around him you see boxes of TNT",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,2,1,"Old","and then they explode",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
11,3,2,"New","okay so this is a cartoon about",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"

11,3,2,"New","coyote starts chasing roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and roadrunner starts running around the track",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","keeps running and running",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","so coyote keeps running",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and then roadrunner just steps off to the side",NA,"just",NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","in another branch of the tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","aand",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","but coyote keeps going around and around and around",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and then c uh",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","roadrunner just says BEEP BEEP again",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and then coyote comes back",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and starts chasing him again in the right direction",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","so they keep going and going",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","until roadrunner comes onto an elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","it’s not really an elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","it’s like a flat platform ?",NA,"like","?","11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","that has strings attached to it",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","like pulleys ?",NA,"like","?","11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","goes up and down ?",NA,NA,"?","11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","so roadrunner comes onto that",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","says BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and goes down",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","so then coyote looks around",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and right next to it conveniently is placed another elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","of the same style",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","so coyote jumps onto that",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","but because he jumps onto that",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","he goes down and the other thing comes back up",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","so then he gets really angry",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and somehow they meet up again","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and roadrunner starts running into this tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","that’s going zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","again they show you a flat map",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","you know going zigzag","yeah","you know",NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","so I guess it’s like up and down you know …",NA,"I guess, like, you know",NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and so coyote keeps chasing roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","until they get to the end",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and it forks off",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","one branch goes up diagonally",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and one keeps going down this way",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","but both of them become flat",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","they’re not zigzags anymore","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","so roadrunner goes up to the top branch",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and coyote keeps going to this other branch",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and while there",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","he doesn’t notice that not going zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","or that he’s doing that motion of zigzagging",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and he keeps going up and down even in a flat tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","so he keeps going up and down",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","his head hits the ceiling",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and his head is at the ground",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and then up and down",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","until the light on his uh helmet just like fuses",NA,"just, like",NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and so he lands into this big room",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","lights a match ’cause he needs to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and so he see all around him",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","are the boxes and boxes of TNT",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
11,3,2,"New","and so it explodes",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"

13,1,1,"New","they’re in the desert",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","there is a road",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"

13,1,1,"New","coyote’s uh and is chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and like the roadrunner is not going full speed",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","he’s kinda letting the roadrunner hang",NA,"kinda",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","so then he the roadrunner like freezes",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","coyote like tries to jam his fork and knife into him",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and then the roadrunner just takes off",NA,"just",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","aand he’s there with his knife and fork in the road",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","aand he is on like hanging like that",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and he just falls to the ground",NA,"just",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and then umm the next",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","so the coyote has this plan to come up try and get the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and his next plan is",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","he has a boxing glove on a spring that’s wrapped around a rock",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","pushes the boxing glove till the spring is like you know all together",NA,"like, you know",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","so it would shoot out at the roadrunner as he passed",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and he pulls the thing back",NA,"thing",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and has the cord in his coyote has the cord in his hand to like release it ?",NA,"like","?","13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","so that the spring would shoot out ?",NA,NA,"?","13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","ohh and here’s the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","he pulls the spring",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","glove don’t move",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","the rock pushes back",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and puts the uh coyote smashed up against the rock",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and then as he’s like the rock’s smashed up against him",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","you see the the boxing glove come back and like hit him in the face",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","so then coyote comes up with another plan",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and he is on the like the two like cliffs",NA,"like, like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and there’s like a big drop",NA,"like, like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and he has a string",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","a really skinny string going across",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and his plan was uh to",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","when the roadrunner comes down below on the road",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","he’s gonna drop an anvil on him",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","so he walks out on the string with the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and the thing just bellies",NA,"just",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and he’s like touching the ground",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","so the roadrunner comes up next to him",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","makes his noise",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","the coyote throws th the anvil on the side",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","’cause the roadrunner takes off",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","’cause he is gonna go chase him",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","so when he throws the anvil on his side",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","the thing shoots him up in the air",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and he’s got that look on his face like what did I just do",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and um then you see him like point to his back",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","’cause he has like this like green backpack on that was",NA,"like, like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","he thought was a parachute",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","he pulls the cord",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","it’s not a parachute like pots and pans come flying out of it",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and um then he has a thing of aspirin",NA,"a thing",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and he was like pops that in his mouth",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","’cause he hits the ground and smashes",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and then his last plan",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","well it wasn’t really a plan",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","he um saw the ah roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and the roadrunner was going towards like a a coal mine ?",NA,"like","?","13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","coyote chases him",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and um as he gets halfway in he realizes he can’t see anymore",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","so he has to go back and get a a hat with a helmet on",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","when he does that the roadrunner is right there",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","makes his noise scares the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and they go off and cha or they’re chasing each other",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and um the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","all you could see was uh was kinda like a little grid",NA,"kinda, like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","it was like a path that went up and it went like that",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","but then there was like parts to the side",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and uh roadrunner was like a green dot and coyote was the red",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","so coyote is chasing him in the mine",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and then like it just gets really fast",NA,"like, just",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","they keep going in like this little square",NA,"like, just",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and then the roadrunner like started going up",NA,"like, just",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","but then he went into the side",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and then you see the coyote going around thinking he was chasing him",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","but he is not",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","roadrunner makes his noise coyote sees it and goes and follows him",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and then somehow they wind up in like this little zigzag pattern",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and um at the end of it there was uh like a tunnel going up",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and one going straight",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","roadrunner goes up coyote goes down",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and then um you see uh",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","as the coyote is going down",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","he’s like bumping his head on this on the top and bottom of it the path",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and um breaks his light",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and out of nowhere he pulls out a match",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","lights the match and then he’s looking straight",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and all behind him you can see TNT",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","so the match makes it blow up",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and then it just shows the top part of like the um the desert",NA,"like",NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","there’s cactuses",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","and then when it blows up it spells out YIKES",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,1,1,"New","so",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
13,2,2,"New","alright this one is ah roadrunner and coyote ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and the beginning it s shows like the desert",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then the road",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then you see like two like figures like running really fast ?",NA,"like, like","?","13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then it it pauses",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and you see the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","aand like underneath the roadrunner uh",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","in parentheses it says uh incredible speed",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then it flashes the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and it says like carnivore",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and he has a bib on and he has a knife and a fork",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so then when they start moving again",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","like the roadrunner is going like just fast enough",NA,"like, like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so that the the coyote can keep up with him",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","then they like pause for a minute",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and the coyote tries to dig the knife and fork into him",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then the c roadrunner just takes off",NA,"just",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so he the road uh",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","coyote is left with his fork and knife in the ground",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and he falls face first in the ground",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so he comes up with this plan that um",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","that he has a a boxing glove with a spring in it",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","on like tied around a rock",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so that way he’s gonna push the glove in",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then he has a string",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and that way when he saw the coyote or the roadrunner he would pull it",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and the boxing glove would like shoot out at the roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and maybe like knock him out ?",NA,"maybe, like","?","13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","well when he hears the uh roadrunner coming",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","he has already has a string in his hand",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and when he goes to pull it",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","the bo",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","the rock moves back and pushes him up against the uh the mountain",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and he gets like hit",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and the road the roadrunner’s fine",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then you see when they show the coyote again",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","the boxing glove with the spring come back",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and hits him in the face again",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so his next plan he uh he’s on the two like cliffs",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then there’s the road underneath",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and his plan was to have",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","he has an anvil in his hand",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and he is gonna walk out in the middle of it",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and the plan was for the anvil to drop on the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","when he came through",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","but when he walked out on the um the rope it like bellied",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and went it touched the road ?",NA,NA,"?","13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so he is holding the thing in his hand",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and he sees the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and so like he goes to chase the roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","’cause he’s like touching the ground now ?",NA,"like","?","13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","when he throws the anvil to the side it shoots him up in the air",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and um when he is up there",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","he’s like you know has that look on his face",NA,"just, you know",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","like what did I just do",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then um he like points to his back",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then you see like a green backpack ?",NA,"like","?","13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","that he thought it was a parachute",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and he goes to pull the chord",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and it’s a backpack",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and like pots and pans come out of it",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then like at least there he has a a thing of aspirin",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and he takes some of them",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","’cause he knows he was gonna hit the ground",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and he did",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so then the next time he sees the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","he is chasing him into a coal mine ?",NA,NA,"?","13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and like coyote chased him in there",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and as he gets halfway in he realizes he can’t see anymore",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so he has to go back and get the hat with the hel or the light on it",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so and when he is there he sees the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","he makes his noise and beeps at him",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then uh you know it scares him",NA,"you know",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so then they just go off and chase each other",NA,"just",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and all they show is",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","they don’t really show like in the mine",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","you just see like uh like they’re like paths ?","mm-hmm","like, like, like","?","13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and just like it one forms like kinda of a square",NA,"just, like, like kind of",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then on the side of that",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","there’s a a thing here and another one here",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so then you just see",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","well the roadrunner like is represented by like the green dot",NA,"like, like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and the coyote is like a red",NA,"like, like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then you just see the roadrunner going around a square",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and the coyote is following him",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","it gets really fast",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so then halfway through",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","the coyote goes off into like a separate like section",NA,"like, like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and he’s like watching the coyote go around and around",NA,"like, like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","then he makes his beeping noise",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and the coyote comes back and follows him in there",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then they wind up in like a zigzag path",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and um at the end of the zigzag path",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","there’s ah a path going up this way",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then one going st still straight",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","roadrunner goes up",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","coyote goes down",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","as the coyote is looking for him",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","he keeps bumping his head up and down on the thing",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","he breaks his light",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","so then he fall he’s on the ground",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and he pulls a match out of I don’t know where",NA,"I don't know",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","strikes the match and then you see the coyote looking straight ahead",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and all behind him is TNT",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","soo it explodes",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then as you hear the explosion it um",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","it shows the desert and like these cactuses there",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then when it explodes it shows the desert",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and the cactuses spell out YIKES",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,2,2,"New","and then that’s where it ended",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
13,3,1,"Old","alright starts out with you have the coyote and the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and you see desert and this little road",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","you see two figures going really fast",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and then it like the TV freezes",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and you see the coyote or the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and it says incredible speed in parentheses underneath them",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and then it flashes to the coyote and it says carnivore",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","he has this bib on and a knife and a fork",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so then when they like unfreeze it they are running",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and uh roadrunner is not going as fast as he can",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","he’s just letting the coyote hanging around",NA,"just",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so then the roadrunner like freezes for a minute",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and you see the coyote like about to dig his fork and knife into him",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and the roadrunner just takes off",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and um the coyote’s has his fork and knife stuck in the ground",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and he just like lands on his face",NA,"just, like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and smashes his face into the road",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so the coyote comes up with a plan for the next time he sees the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and he has a boxing glove with a spring in it",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and he’s gonna pull it back to the",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","it’s wrapped around the rock",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","he’s gonna pull back to the rock",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and have the string that would release it",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","he was gonna stand behind the rock",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so it would shoot out the the glove at the uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","it might knock him out",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","well when he hears the roadrunner coming",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","he has a sting in his hand he pulls it",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","instead of the glove moving",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","the rock moves",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and it like crushed him up against the side of the mountain",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and he’s like has these like stars and  and stuff like that",NA,"like, like, and stuff like that",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and then you see the glove like come back and punch him in the face",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so then his next plan is um",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","he has there is the two uh cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and then underneath is the road",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and he is gonna have",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","he has a wire going or a rope going across both to one side to the other",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and he’s gonna have an anvil in his hand",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","he’s gonna walk out into the middle",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and wait for the roadrunner to come drop it on him",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","well when he walks out to the middle",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","the thing like bellies",NA,"thing, like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and it touches the road",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so then the roadrunner comes up from the side of him",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","makes his noise",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","coyote gets mad",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and he like throws the anvil to the side",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so that way he would chase the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","but when he does that",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","it flings him up in the air",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and um he as he is up there he like just realized what he’d done",NA,"like, just",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and then he points to his back and you see a green backpack",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","coyote thought it was a parachute but it wasn’t",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so when he pulls the cord it is a backpack",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and like pots and pans come flying out",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and then as he is on his way down",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","he has",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","he has like the acme umm ah ty or like ibuprofen tylenol aspirin whatever",NA,"like, like, whatever",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and then he takes some and so for when he hits the ground",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","then he smashes in the ground when he gets down there",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so then the next time he sees the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","the roadrunner like leads him into the coal mine",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and the coyote follows him",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and when he gets halfway in there he realizes he can’t see anymore",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so he goes back to get a helmet with a light on it",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and like right when he is about to go back coyote is right there or the roadrunner is right there",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","scares him",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so then they just go off chasing each other",NA,"just",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and in the mine it just shows the coyo or the roadrunner as the green light",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and the coyote as the red light",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and there’s just like the paths",NA,"just, like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and the coyote or is chasing the roadrunner around",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so it’s like going really fast",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and then the roadrunner like",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","kinda like goes off into like one of the different tunnels",NA,"kinda, like, like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and you see the coyote still going around and around",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","trying to pretend like he’s following the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and um then the roadrunner makes a noise",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and you see the coyote like come back",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and go to like the thing that the roadrunner is on",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and then they wind up in like a diagonal tunnel",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","it’s going like that",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and um at the end of the diagonal tunnel was uh uh a tunnel going up",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and a tunnel going still going straight",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so um the roadrunner goes up",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","coyote stays straight",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and as the coyote is going through his straight one",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","he keeps hitting his head on the the tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","his light breaks",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and he pulls a match out of somewhere he had a match",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and when it lights up he’s looking straight",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and um all behind him is TNT",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","so that explodes",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","but as it explodes it shows the um the top of the desert",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and there’s cactuses there",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and as it makes the explosion",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","you see the cactuses and they form a YIKES",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
13,3,1,"Old","and that was it",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
14,1,1,"New","alright so the cartoon starts out",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","it’s in the middle of the dessert",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and we see wile e coyote chasing the roadrunner","ohh alright mm-hmm",NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and you see them running very very fast",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and like very blurry blurred because they are moving so fast","mm-hmm","like",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and then all of a sudden you see it like a freeze frame on the roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and that says name roadrunner and then like his name in latin",NA,"like",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","like includibilus something or other",NA,"like, something or other",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and then it does the same wile e coyote",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","show so it shows its name coyote",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and then like carnivorus vulgaris",NA,"like",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","alright ?",NA,NA,"?","14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and so instead of going back it like it starts going in slow motion now",NA,"like",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and you see that uh wile e coyote",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","he has a knife and fork in hand like this",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and he has like a handkerchief around his neck",NA,"like",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and then they slowly work up to full speed",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and he’s about to to like stab the roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","with the fork and knife",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","but then roadrunner goes MEEP MEEP",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and he runs away",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and instead he stabs the ground",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","so he is on the ground now",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and he is looking frustrated",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and then you know he puts his finger in the air like he has an idea",NA,"you know",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","alright ?",NA,NA,"?","14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and so the next scene is there’s like a big rock",NA,"like",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and he attaches this contraption to it",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","so there’s like a punching like a boxing glove uh on",NA,"like",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and it’s attached to a large metal spring",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"

14,1,1,"New","the coyote stands behind the rock",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and as the roadrunner is running by on the street",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","like he he unlatches uh expecting the punching bag to hit him",NA,"like",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","but instead the rock moves backwards",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and smashes him into the cliff behind him",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","so he’s standing there",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and he looks you know terrible because he’s been smashed",NA,"you know",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and then the the the boxing glove comes back at him",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"

14,1,1,"New","alright ?",NA,NA,"?","14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","so after this",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","we see a blueprint on the screen for his next plan",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and it shows like two cliffs with like um",NA,"like, like",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","like a drop in between them",NA,"like, like",NA,"14-1-1-New"

14,1,1,"New","and it shows like a tightwire on top of it",NA,"like",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and you see his plans on the side",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","it says something like uh",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","walk across tightwire",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","drop anvil on roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and then roadrunner burger",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","okay ?",NA,NA,"?","14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","so we see him on top of one side of the cliff",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and he has the anvil","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","he’s carrying it across the wire",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and when he steps on the wire",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","you know he starts to drop slowly towards the street",NA,"you know",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and then the roadrunner runs up to him and goes MEEP MEEP",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and then you know runs away in the opposite direction",NA,"you know",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and so he’s he’s looking frustrated",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","he throws the anvil to the side",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and he gets launched up in the air",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"

14,1,1,"New","thinking there’s a parachute",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","but in fact a lot of utensils just fall out of the backpack",NA,"just",NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and then he grabs a box of aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"

14,1,1,"New","and then he gulps down the aspirin ?",NA,NA,"?","14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and then he waves bye bye",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and then he falls down to the to the ground",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and so the next scene is",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","they’re running along the coyote chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"
14,1,1,"New","and you see a sign for a cactus mine",NA,NA,NA,"14-1-1-New"

15,3,2,"New","he’s gonna come through that road",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","so he’s trying to drop it on him",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","so he goes through this like rope",NA,"like",NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","like a tightrope ?",NA,NA,"?","15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","aand then it’s like rubber right? it’s like a resort kind of",NA,"like, sort of","?","15-3-2-New"

15,3,2,"New","and obviously the weight is really heavy",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","so he sinks down ?",NA,NA,"?","15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","and he ends up right in front of roadrunner ?",NA,NA,"?","15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","with the weight in his hands ?",NA,NA,"?","15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","and roadrunner just you know",NA,"just, you know",NA,"15-3-2-New"

15,3,2,"New","but he runs back",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","so the coyote runs after him",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","so he’s chasing after him in like a maze ?","mm-hmm","like","?","15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","like the cave’s sort of a maze",NA,"like, sort of",NA,"15-3-2-New"

15,3,2,"New","and through you know criss-cross",NA,"you know",NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","and then he has him going in circles like that",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","and then he realizes that",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","the coyote realizes that the roadrunner went the other way",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","’cause he was like BEEP BEEP",NA,"like",NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","so he then run over there",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","so he’s going in circles and he goes straight ?",NA,NA,"?","15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","then he has him going through like a zigzag",NA,"like",NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","and then finally like somehow",NA,"like",NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","he like tricks him into going to a like a dark spot",NA,"like, like",NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","and he’s lost coyote’s lost",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"

15,3,2,"New","and like he ends up being in like like a ton of dynamite",NA,"like, like, like",NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","so he blows himself up",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","and then like the end is just like",NA,"like, just, like",NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","there’s a word that says YIPE",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","and then like it’s written in cactus like green sort of",NA,"like, like, sort of",NA,"15-3-2-New"
15,3,2,"New","and that’s it",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"
16,1,1,"New","the cartoon was a wild e. coyote cartoon",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","the roadrunner ?",NA,NA,"?","16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","I don’t know if you’ve ever seen that",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and um the cartoon starts off where",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","the coyote is chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","but the roadrunner is going too fast",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","so like he can’t catch up to it ?",NA,"like","?","16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and the coyote has um",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","he’s holding like a knife and a fork",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and he’s like trying to eat the roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","they’re running",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","aand he can’t catch up to it",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","so then he comes up with these like plans",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","in order to catch the roadrunner?",NA,NA,"?","16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","so the first plan",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","he had um like a boxing glove connected to",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","a spring",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and he tied it to a rock",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","so that way he would like pull the spring back",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and then like when the roadrunner runs by",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","he would let go of the spring",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and then like the boxing glove would hit it ?",NA,"like","?","16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and kill it I guess",NA,"I guess",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","but instead of really doing that",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","thee uh the rock backfires",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and like hits him",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","so like he doesn’t get it",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and then he decides to put a string",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","connected from one mountain into another ?",NA,NA,"?","16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and he would carry like a big anvil",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and like walk into the middle of the string",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and then when the roadrunner like ran down",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","it would uh drop the anvil on it",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","but when he walks onto thee the s",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","the e rope that he has",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","instead of it like staying up there it comes all the way down",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","so now he’s like on the floor with the anvil in his hand",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and the roadrunner like runs up to him",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and he drops the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and he like ricochets up into the air",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","because of like the uh","mm-hmm","like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","the string was like pulled down","yeah","like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and he had this uh parachute ?",NA,NA,"?","16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","on his back",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","but when he pulled the string of the parachute",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","all these like little items fall out",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","so there’s no parachute",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","so he ends up like falling to the ground",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","aand then the roadrunner like runs into some cave",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","or something",NA,"or something",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","so he’s following him into the cave",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and like running around the cave or whatever",NA,"like, or whatever",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and he can’t catch up to him",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and he keeps like being outsmarted by the roadrunner ?",NA,"like","?","16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and then so they’re like running all around for a while",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","aand then he finds himself like",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","it’s like really dark in the cave",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","so he lights a match",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and there’s all like TNT and dynamite behind him ?",NA,"like","?","16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","so then like he blows up",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","and that’s the end basically",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,1,1,"New","so he never catches the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
16,2,2,"New","um okay it was a roadrunner and wile e. coyote uh","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","cartoon",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","so the cartoon starts off with",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","I mean the coyote chasing the roadrunner",NA,"I mean",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and the coyote has like a fork and a knife in his hand",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","he’s trying to like catch up to the roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and eat it",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","but the c the roadrunner is too fast",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","so he never catches up to him",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","so he thinks of plaans in order to catch the roadrunner ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","so his first plan was",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","that he’s gonna take a boxing glove that’s connected to a spring ?",NA,NA,"?","16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and tie it to a rock",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","aand when the roadrunner like runs by",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","he’ll like pull the thing",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and then like the spring will go",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and hit the roadrunner or whatever ?",NA,"or whatever","?","16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","but instead of that happening",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","like the rock that it’s tied to ricochets back into him",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","so like it ends up hurting him ?",NA,"like","?","16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and then he decides to take a uh a string",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","or rope or whatever?",NA,"or whatever","?","16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and tie it from one mountain to another",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and he’d walk across the string",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","holding an anvil ?",NA,NA,"?","16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and then when the roadrunner goes like under him",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","he’s gonna drop the anvil onto the roadrunner ?",NA,NA,"?","16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","but when he walks onto the the rope",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","it since it’s like so heavy",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","the rope just like goes down to the floor ?",NA,"just, like","?","16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and then the roadrunner comes",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","aand he’s like holding the anvil in his hand",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and can’t like drop it on him",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","so he like drops the anvil",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and then he like flies up into the air ?",NA,"like","?","16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and he has a um a parachute on his back",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","so when he goes to pull the parachute string",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","instead of there being a parachute in there",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","there’s all like little items",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","like a bowl or something that falls out",NA,"like, or something",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","so it ends up falling to the ground",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","like there’s no parachute",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and then they",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","the roadrunner is like running through some caves",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","so he chases the roadrunner into a cave",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and they’re like running all around or whatever",NA,"like, or whatever",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and he can’t catch up to him",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and he’s like being outsmarted by the roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","‘cause he’s like running",NA,"like",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and the roadrunner stops him and he’s standing there",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and he doesn’t realize it",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","aand then it becomes like really dark in the cave ?",NA,"like","?","16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","so thee the coyote lights a match",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and then to like see or whatever ?",NA,"like, or whatever","?","16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and there’s all like TNT and dynamite behind him",NA,"like, or whatever",NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","so he ends up blowing up",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,2,2,"New","and that’s the end of the cartoon","okay",NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
16,3,1,"Old","um it’s the wild e. coyot coyote and roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"16-3-1-Old"

2,1,1,"New","so that idea doesn’t work",NA,NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","so then he comes up with an idea that",NA,NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","he connects a tightrope between two cliffs ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and he walks out on it with an anvil ?",NA,NA,"?","2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","like a really heavy block or whatever ?","mm-hmm","like, or whatever","?","2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","so that weighs down the tightrope so","and this is between two cliffs",NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","yeah so then he walks out on the tightrope with an anvil",NA,NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and because of the weight of the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","it drops into the middle of the road","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and I gue I don’t know what he’s plan is",NA,"I gue, I don't know",NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","I guess to like shoot the roadrunner up in the air or something?","okay","I guess, like, or something","?","2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","so like he will step on the tightrope and it will spring back up ?",NA,"like","?","2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","but it doesn’t work again","uh-huh",NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and he gets like flung in the air",NA,"like",NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and then his parachute doesn’t work","okay",NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","so he like takes aspirin",NA,"like",NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and like I guess he dies or whatever",NA,"like, I guess, or whatever",NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","he like crashes to the ground","uh-huh","like",NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and then","and that’s also part of the cartoon that he dies?",NA,"?","2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","I don’t know he just like falls and like",NA,"I don't know, just, like, like",NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and then like",NA,"like",NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and then it switches to another scene where",NA,NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","he’s chasing the roadrunner again in like an old mine","mm-hmm","like",NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and they’re chasing each other in the dark",NA,NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and they have their mining hats on","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and they each have a different light",NA,NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and you just see the lights like chasing each other around in the dark","mm-hmm mm-hmm","like",NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and then it ends with",NA,NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","the coyote like lighting a match",NA,"like",NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and he’s surrounded by dynamite which he doesn’t realize",NA,NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and when he lights the match",NA,NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","the whole thing explodes ?",NA,NA,"?","2-1-1-New"
2,1,1,"New","and that’s pretty much the end of the cartoon","okay",NA,NA,"2-1-1-New"
2,2,2,"New","okay so the cartoon is about the roadrunner and the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","do you know that one ?","yeah",NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","okay so the coyote is like chasing he roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and he wants to eat him",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","’cause like he has a knife and a fork",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and he doesn’t get the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and he gets really frustrated",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and he like thinks up a plot to get him",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and the first plot that he thinks of is that",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","he rigs like a a punching no like a fist",NA,"like, like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","like a punching glove",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","so that it will like spring out of a boulder",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","as the roadrunner is going by",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and I guesslike punch him ?",NA,"I guess, like","?","2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","but something goes wrong and",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","the coyote ends up getting smooshed by the boulder",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and gets punched in the face by like his own contraption ?",NA,"like","?","2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","so that doesn’t work",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","so then he decides that that he’s",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","he’s going to take a tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and like fix it between two cliffs",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","so there’s a tightrope connecting two cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and he’s going to take an anvil",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","like a really like heavy block ?",NA,"like, like","?","2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and he’s gonna walk out on it",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and because of the weight",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","the tightrope is going to dip down to the middle of the ground below",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","where the roadrunner would be running ?",NA,NA,"?","2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","so I guess he figures that the roadrunner is gonna step on the tightrope",NA,"I guess",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and it will spring back up and like fling him in the air",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","but it doesn’t work out obviously",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","so what happens is like the coyote ends up getting flung in the air",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and while he’s like up in the air",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","he doesn’t like have a parachute in his little backpack",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","so he like falls to the ground",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and I don’t know I guess he doesn’t die",NA,"I don't know, I guess",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","but so then they are in like a mine field ?",NA,"like","?","2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","like you know with mining hats and everything",NA,"like, you know",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and the coyote is chasing the roadrunner around in the dark ?",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and they have like little lights on their hats ?",NA,"like","?","2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","so all you see is the different color lights",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","chasing each other in the different tunnels ?",NA,NA,"?","2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and it ends with the coyote like lighting a match",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and he’s surrounded by dynamite ?",NA,NA,"?","2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and he doesn’t know that",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","but he ends up exploding like the whole mine field",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and it says like YIKES up on top",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,2,2,"New","and that’s the end",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
2,3,1,"Old","so the cartoon involves the roadrunner and the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and the coyote is always trying to get the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","but the roadrunner’s too fast",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","so in the first scene it’s the coyote chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and he wants to eat him",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","he has like a knife and a fork",NA,"like",NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","I guess yeah he wants you know to eat him",NA,"I guess, you know",NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","but the roadrunner outruns him",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","so he ends up getting really frustrated",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and he like devises these different like plots",NA,"like, like",NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","for how he’s gonna trap the roadrunner ?",NA,NA,"?","2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and the first one he comes up with is that",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","he somehow attaches like a boxing glove on a spring to a boulder ?",NA,"like","?","2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and he rigs it up",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","so that when the roadrunner runs past he’ll release the boxing glove",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and the spring will like punch him the roadrunner ?",NA,"like","?","2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","but it doesn’t end it doesn’t work and whatever and ends up that",NA,"and whatever",NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","the coyote gets smooshed by the boulder",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and he gets punched in the face",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","so the roadrunner gets away",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","so his second plot is that",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","he devises a tightrope ? between two cliffs",NA,NA,"?","2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and he takes an anvil",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and he walks out on the tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","so that the weight of the anvil will like lower the tightrope ?",NA,"like","?","2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","so that when the roadrunner steps on it",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","when he’s on the road below",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","then he’ll like fling up in the air",NA,"like",NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","but it doesn’t work",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and the coyote gets thrown up in the air",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and there’s no parachute in his little backpack ? to save him ?",NA,NA,"?, ?","2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","so he like falls to the ground and I guess he dies or whatever",NA,"like, I guess, or whatever",NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and then it switches to them chasing each other in like a mine field ?",NA,"like, I guess, or whatever","?","2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","but it’s underground ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","okay",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","so they’re wearing their little hats with the lights on it",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","so all you see is the little lights like chasing each other in the tunnels ?",NA,"like","?","2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and it finally ends with the coyote like lighting a match",NA,"like",NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and it lights up all the dynamite around him",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","that he doesn’t know that it’s there",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and he ends up exploding the whole mine field",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
2,3,1,"Old","and that’s the end of the cartoon",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
20,1,1,"New","okay um it was uh the roadrunner and the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"20-1-1-New"

20,3,1,"Old","um in the next scene",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"

20,3,1,"Old","the tightrope sank down",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","and um when the roadrunner came by",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","he saw that he was down to the ground with him",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","so thee uh coyote realized that",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","he was no good",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","so he throw the anvil down to the ground",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","but then he shot all the way up to the sky",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","um and on his way down",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"

20,3,1,"Old","was the coyo coyote chasing the um roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","into a mine",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","and the mine went off in two directions",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","aand um thee coyote",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","the roadrunner went in one direction",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","and the coyote went in the other direction",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","and when the coyote realized that he went the wrong way",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","he uh lit a match so he could see where he was",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","and um then he realized that he was surrounded with TNT",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","aand the whole thing blew up",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","and the smoke spelled uh the word YIPPIE or YIPE",NA,NA,NA,"20-3-1-Old"
20,3,1,"Old","I don’t know",NA,"I don't know",NA,"20-3-1-Old"
21,1,1,"New","this one was the coyote aand uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and it starts off",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and roadrunner is running",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and wile e. coyote is running behind him",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and then it freezes",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and it shows um roadrunner like in midair",NA,"like",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and it says roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and underneath his scientific name",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","which I was trying to remember",NA,"I was trying to remember",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","but it just didn’t happen",NA,"just",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and then um aft behind him",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","is the coyote and he freezes",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he’s got a fork and knife in his hands",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and it says um coyote",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and underneath carnivorous something or other",NA,"something or other",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and then um it starts up again",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and they’re running",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he’s chasing after him with the fork and knife",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he thinks he’s got him",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he’s just about to stab um roadrunner",NA,"just",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and then roadrunner takes off",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","he takes like a burst of acceleration",NA,"like",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so he sstabs the ground",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and then he’s like stuck in the ground with his fork and his knife",NA,"like",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and his feet are up in the air",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he then he stops",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he sits down and his going like this",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and thinking",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and then he has an idea",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so he gives like a thumbs up",NA,"like",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and um he goes and he gets this rock",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","with like a fist",NA,"like",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","like a boxing glove attached to it",NA,"like",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and a spring",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he pushes it back to the rock",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and I guess he’s gonna let it go",NA,"I guess",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so it punches the roadrunner when he runs by",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so the roadrunner comes",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he pulls the string",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and the fist stays in place",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and the rock goes back",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and pushes him into a rock",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and then the fist comes back",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and punches him in the head",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so now he’s got another idea",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so he gets a blueprint",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and it’s um a tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and him carrying an anvil out standing on the tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and dropping the anvil on the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","when he runs by",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","it’s between two cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so it says um plaan you know",NA,"you know",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","walk out on tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","number two drop anvil on roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","number three roadrunner burger or something like that",NA,"or something like that",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","um so he drops his blueprint",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he goes out with his um anvil",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","but the anvil is too heavy",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and it weighs him down the line",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so he ends up down on the ground",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and the roadrunner comes",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he’s just holding it",NA,"just",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","the roadrunner comes",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he turns around he goes back",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so he gets mad",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","he just throws the anvil",NA,"just",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","but now the line isn’t heavy anymore",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so he goes flying up into the air",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he’s got on a green backpack",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he pulls a string",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","but all kinds of junk starts coming out",NA,"kinds of junk",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and no parachute",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so then um he grabs aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","out of his pack",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","it says acme aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he takes an aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he likekinda waves",NA,"like, kinda",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and then he goes flying down onto the ground",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","um then he’s chasing the roadrunner again",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he chases him into some mines ?",NA,NA,"?","21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he starts running into the mine",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and it starts getting dark",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so he runs back to the beginning",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he gets a hat",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","with a light on it",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and the roadrunner is behind him",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","he has a hat with the light on it",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and the roadrunner’s light is green",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and his is red",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and so when they start running through the mine",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","you just see like a top view ?",NA,"like","?","21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and a little red light ?",NA,NA,"?","21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","um and a little green light ?",NA,NA,"?","21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","the red light is like chasing the green light",NA,"like",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and it’s him chasing the co um the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so they’re chasing each other around and around",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and around and around",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","um and then at one point he kinda loses him",NA,"kinda",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and his and his light goes out",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he stops",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","so he lights a match",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and he looks around him",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and it’s all TNT and explosives and stuff",NA,"and stuff",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and the next thing you see",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","like above the ground",NA,"like",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","you see just like the desert",NA,"just, like",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and you hear a big explosion",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and then the there’s cactuses",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and they say YIKES",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","or something like that",NA,"or something like that",NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and that’s how it ends",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","and that’s it",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,1,1,"New","that was a little longer",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
21,2,2,"New","this one was wile e. coyote and the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","um it starts off with roadrunner running",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and coyote chasing after him",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and then it freezes",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and it shows um coyote like in in midair",NA,"like",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and it says um",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","not the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","the roadrunner is in midair",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and says roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and underneath his scientific name",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","but I can’t remember it","okay","but I can't remember",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and then it moves over to coyote",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and he’s running",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and he’s got a fork and a knife in his hands",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and it says um coyote",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and underneath it says his scientific name",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so then it starts up again",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and they’re running",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and coyote is just that thinks he caught up with him",NA,"just",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so he goes to stab him with his fork and his knife",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and the coyote gets uh",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","the roadrunner gets a burst of acceleration",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and he runs off",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and um the coyote ends up stabbing into the street",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","um or the road or whatever",NA,"or whatever",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so he’s uh kinda stuck in the road by his hands",NA,"kinda",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and his feet are sticking up in the air",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and then he um kinda falls down",NA,"kinda",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and he’s sitting on the ground and thinking",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and then he comes up with a plan",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and he gives like a thumbs up",NA,"like",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and then um he",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","you see him with this contraption",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","it’s a big boulder",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and it’s um like a boxing glove on a spring",NA,"like",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","attached to the boulder",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so he pulls it back",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and ties it up with a little string",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so that um when co uh",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","the roadrunner comes by",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","he’ll let it go and it will punch him",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so the roadrunner comes",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and he pulls the string",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","but the fist thing stays in place",NA,"thing",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and the rock goes backwards",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and pushes him into another rock",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and then the fist comes",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and punches him in the head",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so that didn’t work",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so um then he’s drawn up a blueprint",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and it’s like two cliffs",NA,"like",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","with a tightrope in between",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and he’s gonna walk out with an anvil",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and drop it on the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","when he comes running by",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and on the side it says",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","um step oone walk on the tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","step twoo drop anvil on roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and step three is like roadrunner burger",NA,"like",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so he tries to do that",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and he takes his anvil",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and he walks out",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","but the anvil’s so heavy that it weighs down the line",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so he’s all the way down to the ground now",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","just holding his anvil",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","the roadrunner runs up to him",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","sees him",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and does his little MEEP MEEP noise thing",NA,"thing",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and then he goes running back",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so um he you know thinks that’s it",NA,"you know",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so he just throws his anvil to the side",NA,"just",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","but now he’s not weighed down anymore",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so he goes flying into the air on the string",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","um and as he’s coming down",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","in his backpack",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"

21,2,2,"New","and it says acme aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and he takes one",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"

21,2,2,"New","and falls down",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","then hee’s chasing him again",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and he chases him into a mine",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and they’re running",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and then it gets dark",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and he can’t see anymore",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so he goes back to the beginning",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","um and then he stops cause his light goes out?",NA,NA,"?","21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","so the roadrunner has a hat with the green light?",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and the coyote has a light uh hat with the red light",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"

21,2,2,"New","and around and around",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","um and then he stops cause his light goes out",NA,NA,"?","21-2-2-New"

21,2,2,"New","and the next thing you know",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","you’re looking at like up at the desert",NA,"like",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","I guess above where they are under ground",NA,"I guess",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and you hear like an explosion",NA,"like",NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and then the cactuses kinda go into the shape",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","of saying YIKES",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,2,2,"New","and that’s it","okay",NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
21,3,1,"Old","okay so it starts off",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","roadrunner wile e. coyote",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","um coyote’s chasing the roadrunner ?",NA,NA,"?","21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","um they pause",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and uh roadrunner is in midair kind of running",NA,"kind of",NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and it says roadrunner and his scientific name",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","then they go back",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and they show coyote and his scien",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","carnivorous something","fork and knife","something",NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and underneath his name",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","yeah with his knife and fork",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","right",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and um then they start up again",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","roadrunner’s running",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and coyote thinks he’s got him",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","so he goes to stab him with his knife and fork",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and gets like a burst of acceleration",NA,"like",NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and he runs off",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and um he stabs him",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","goes to stab him",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","but he ends up stabbing the road underneath him",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and his feet are sticking up in the air",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","so he’s a little frustrated",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and now he’s sitting there thinking",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and he comes up with a plan",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","so he gives a thumbs up",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and then he’s got this contraption",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","with a big boulder",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","with a like a boxing glove fist thing attached to it",NA,"like, thing",NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","on a spring",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and he pulls the spring back",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","ties it up",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","so when the roadrunner comes by",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","he'll let it go",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and it’ll punch him",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","so roadrunner comes by",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","pulls the string",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","but the glove stays in place",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and the boulder hits him",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","pushes him back into a bould another boulder",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and then the glove comes back",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and punches him in the head",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and so that didn't work",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","so now he has a blueprint for a new plan",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","there’s two cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","uh a tightrope in the middle",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and he’s gonna walk out on the tightrope with an anvil",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","so it’s got",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","step one walk out onto the rope",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","step twoo drop the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","step three roadrunner burger",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","or something like that",NA,"or something like that",NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","so um he tries this",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","he you know",NA,"you know",NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","he throws his blueprint aside",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","he takes his anvil",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and he walks out onto the rope",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and he uh goes to",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","well he gets out to the middle of the rope",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","but it’s too heavy",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","so it weighs him down",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and now he’s standing on the ground",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","holding his anvil",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","roadrunner runs up to him",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","sees him",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and runs back in the other direction",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and so he throws his anvil aside",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","but now the rope is not weighed down anymore",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","so he goes flying up into the air",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","he’s got his backpack",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","um as he’s falling",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","he’s reaching for stuff",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and he pulls a string for the parachute",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","but it’s just his backpack opens",NA,"just",NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and it’s all stuff’s coming out",NA,"all stuff's",NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","but no parachute",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","so he takes an aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and kinda waves",NA,"kinda",NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and he just falls",NA,"just",NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","um then you see him again chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","just chasing after him",NA,"just",NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","chasing him into a mine",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","so he starts running into the mine",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and it gets too dark",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and you just see like his eyeballs",NA,"just, like",NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and um so he runs back to the beginning",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"

21,3,1,"Old","coyote has a hat with a red light",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","so then they run into the mine",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","and you just see a top view",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
21,3,1,"Old","like a little maze-looking thing",NA,"like, maze-looking",NA,"21-3-1-Old"

3,1,1,"New","it was a roadrunner and coyote cartoon ?",NA,NA,"?","3-1-1-New"
3,1,1,"New","and it starts off with them running and chasing each other",NA,NA,NA,"3-1-1-New"
3,1,1,"New","then it slows to slow motion",NA,NA,NA,"3-1-1-New"

3,1,1,"New","and he sets up this  uh",NA,NA,NA,"3-1-1-New"
3,1,1,"New","this metal contraption",NA,NA,NA,"3-1-1-New"

3,1,1,"New","and he just had to pull a string to let it go",NA,NA,NA,"3-1-1-New"
3,1,1,"New","so he’s sitting behind the rock and he does this",NA,NA,NA,"3-1-1-New"
3,1,1,"New","and then instead of it um going to uh punch the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"3-1-1-New"

3,2,1,"Old","and it’s it he starts off in slow motion again",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","and then it eventually catches up to speed",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","and then the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","catches up and he runs from coyote",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","and he’s started",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","and he’s started thinking about how to catch him",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","and he uses this contraption",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"

3,2,1,"Old","when the roadrunner runs",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","instead of it working to his advantage it backfired",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","and the rock ends up um catapulting him into another rock",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","and then the boxing glove eventually comes back",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","a few minutes uh a few seconds later",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","and hits him in the face",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"

3,2,1,"Old","and keeps running and running and realizes he can’t see anything",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","so he runs back out",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"

3,2,1,"Old","with one in green and he’s got one in red",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","and then they chase each other through the mine shafts for quite a while",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","and then he finally ca closing in on him",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","he runs through a mine shaft that’s pretty oddly shaped",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"

3,2,1,"Old","his hard hat and the light in the hard hat ends up breaking",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","and he loses the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","however he lights a match then to find out where he’s at",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","and he ends up being in a mine where there’s a bunch of dynamite",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","and um it explodes",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
3,2,1,"Old","over underneath a patch of cactus",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"

3,3,2,"New","running after each other in the mine shafts",NA,NA,NA,"3-3-2-New"
3,3,2,"New","until he finally starts closing in on him",NA,NA,NA,"3-3-2-New"
3,3,2,"New","and then he ends up going to this really weird mine shaft",NA,NA,NA,"3-3-2-New"
3,3,2,"New","where it’s oddly shaped",NA,NA,NA,"3-3-2-New"
3,3,2,"New","and he ends up breaking the light on the hard hat",NA,NA,NA,"3-3-2-New"

4,1,1,"New","and the punging glove will swing out and hit him",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"

4,1,1,"New","and he decides that he’ll drop it on the road runner when he comes by",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","but when he walks on the tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","it stretches right down to the ground",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"

4,1,1,"New","till he realizes chases after the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","and then they’re going in a uh jigsaw",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","uh not a jigsaw",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","like a saw blade up and down up and down up and down","mm-hmm","like",NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","and they’re chasing after each other",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","and at the end uh the coyote is a little far behind",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","so the roadrunner goes up",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","the coyote doesn’t see it so he goes down at the end",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","‘cause there’s two different paths","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","but he’s still hitting the ceiling and the ground the ceiling and the ground",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","for being used to running up and down",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","and he stops and his hat is broken so he lights a match",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","and he’s in a room full of dynamite",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","it explodes",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","and it cuts to the uh the surface and there’s a bunch of cactuses",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","and when it explodes they sh fly up in the air and fall back down",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","and they all say YIKES",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,1,1,"New","and that’s it",NA,NA,NA,"4-1-1-New"
4,2,2,"New","alright so this is a roadrunner and wile e. coyote cartoon",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so they’re blazing down the road",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and it stops  on roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and it says roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and then like speed increbulus or something in the bottom",NA,"like, or something",NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","something they’re trying to pretend it’s Latin",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and it goes up to wile e. coyote",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","it says under him wile e. coyote",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and then some other made up Latin",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and then start going slowly again and they take off",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and they’re running incredibly fast on the road",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and you see wile e. coyote has a uh fork and a knife in his hands ?",NA,NA,"?","4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","he makes a lunge trying to stab him down the road runner ?",NA,NA,"?","4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","the roadrunner just takes off even faster",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and just hits the ground",NA,"just",NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so he comes up with a plan",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","he decides to go take a boxing glove",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","put a spring in it attach the other end of the spring to a uh rock",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","he pulls it back",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and hooks it against the rock so it won’t fly out",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","until he lets go of the hook",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","he hides behind the rock",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","he’s gonna wait for the roadrunner to come by",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and he’ll pull the hook",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","the boxing glove will fly out",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and hit the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so he’s hiding behind the rock",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and you hear the roadrunner coming",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and you hear him going BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and you hear the wind tearing by him",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so he lets go of the hook at the right moment",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","but instead of the boxing glove shooting forward the rock shoots back",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and flies him into a wall so now he’s smashed against the wall",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and then you see him look panicked",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","‘cause the boxing glove flies back now",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and hits him in the face",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so he comes up with a different plan this time",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","he decides he’s gonna put a tightrope between two cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","he’s gonna walk between them with a huge anvil in his hands",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and he’ll drop it on the roadrunner when the roadrunner walks by",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","you see his blueprints and everything’s great",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so he walks on the tightrope with the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","but the anv but the tightrope stretches down",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and now he’s on the ground on the tightrope with an anvil in his hands",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so he can’t drop it on anything",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","the roadrunner comes up",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","does his little BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","flies away",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so the wil",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so the coyote throws the anvil on the ground and goes chasing after him",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","but when he throws the anvil on the ground",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","the tightrope goes back to how it was shoots him up in the air",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","but he looks kind of confident now",NA,"kind of",NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and the camera pans to the side and you see that he’s got a parachute on",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so he pulls the rope of the parachute when he starts going down",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","but instead of a parachute coming out random crap comes out",NA,"random crap",NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","like an axe and a plate and a bowl and a spoon and a banana",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","you know whatnot not a parachute",NA,"you know, whatnot",NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so he’s flying down",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","he looks panicked",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so he takes his acme uh aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","opens it up and",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","grabs a few out of the air",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","‘cause you know they’re all flying straight up",NA,"you know",NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and then he just waves goodbye to the camera",NA,"just",NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","as he flies down",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and hits the ground",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and there’s a little mushroom cloud",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and so this time thee roadrunner go",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","runs into the uh old cactus mine or something",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and wile e. coyote chases after him",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and he’s running after him through the mine and it gets pitch black",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so he runs back to the beginning and he grabs one of those little hats",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","like those mining hats with the lights on",NA,"like",NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","then the roadrunner flies up and the roadrunner has one too",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and ru roadrunner’s light is green and the coyote’s is red",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so they’re running after each other",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and it switches from like seeing them to seeing sort of a bigger map?",NA,"like, sort of","?","4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","with just their lights on it ?",NA,NA,"?","4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and you see them running through a map",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","thee roadrunner gets in an elevator",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","the coyote chases after him",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","they’re running around for a while",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","the roadrunner gets on a uh ladder",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so the roadrunner goes up the coyote chases after him",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","the roadrunner goes down on the other side",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and they’re just running in a circle for a while",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","but the roadrunner stops and then goes somewhere else",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","but the coyote is still running in a circle then he realizes it and stops",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","runs after the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","the roadrunner jumps a little gap and the coyote can’t quite jump it",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so he grabs onto a cliff and just barely pulls himself up",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and then they’re running in sort of a saw blade",NA,"sort of",NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so they like up down up down up down up down",NA,"like",NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and the coyote is chasing after him",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","but the roadrunner is getting a little ahead",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","at the end of the saw blade the uh path goes either up or straight",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and the roadrunner goes straight but the coyote doesn’t see that",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so the coyote runs",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","no the roadrunner goes up but the coyote doesn’t see that",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so the coyote goes straight",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","but he’s still bouncing up and down up and down up and down",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and breaks his light",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","so he lights a match to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","he’s in a room full of dynamite oh no",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and then it cuts to the surface?",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and you just hear the explosion",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and all the cactuses fly up in the air and fall back down",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and the cactuses say YIKES when they fall down",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,2,2,"New","and then that’s it",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
4,3,1,"Old","alright so it’s a wile e. coyote and roadrunner cartoon",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","you see them flying down the road",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","and it stops",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","it says road runner and something in their little made up Latin",NA,"and something",NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","like speediculis incrediblis","mm-hmm","like",NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","and then goes wile e. coyote and something else made up in Latin","mm-hmm","and something",NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","and they slowly speed back up again",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","so they’re running at the speed they were",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","and then coyote goes to dive on him",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","with the fork and knife that he has in his hands",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","but the roadrunner just takes off",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","and he just hits the ground",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","so he decides to come up with a plan",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","he’ll take a boxing glove",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","put a spring in it put the other end of the spring on a rock",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","pulls the boxing glove back against the rock",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","and clips it to the rock",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","so it won’t fly out till he’s ready",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","and stands behind the rock",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","waits to hear the roadrunner coming",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","lets go of the clip so it will fly out",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","the boxing glove stays where it is and the rock shoots back",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","shoots him against the wall so he’s pushed between the wall and the rock",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","then he looks all panicked",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"

4,3,1,"Old","and punches him in the face",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","so instead he decides to get a tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","put the tightrope between two cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","and walk out with an anvil",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"

4,3,1,"Old","it stretches right down to the bottom",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","because of the weight of the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","so the roadrunner comes up",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","does his little BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","flies away",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"

4,3,1,"Old","he takes out his aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"

4,3,1,"Old","he’s still running around in circle running around in circle",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"

4,3,1,"Old","he doesn’t quite make it",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","he has to pull himself up to the other cliff",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"

4,3,1,"Old","the roadrunner is doing it fine",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","the coyote is going up down up down up down up down",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"

4,3,1,"Old","the roadrunner goes up at the end because it splits",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","but instead of going on the up path the coyote goes in the straight path",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","but he’s so used to running up and down and up and down",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"
4,3,1,"Old","that he’s apparently still bouncing up and down and up and down",NA,NA,NA,"4-3-1-Old"

6,1,1,"New","as usual",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and um you see the roadrunner running really really fast",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and coyote trying to chase him",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and they they stop for a second",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","to show the names roadrunner and coyote",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then they keep on going",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and coyote’s trying to run after roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","he has a fork and a knife in his hands",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he thinks he’s gonna get him because he gets really close to him",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","but then he tries to stab him with the fork and the knife",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","but of course he escapes","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then he stabs the floor instead",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he’s just laying there frustrated thinking",NA,"just",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then he comes up with a plan",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so um you see him",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","he puts like this metal thing around a big rock",NA,"like, thing",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then he has a boxing glove that he attaches like a spring to it ?","mm-hmm","like","?","6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so he pulls it back so that it’s not sticking out",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so basically likeI guess he’s gonna like press a button",NA,"like, I guess, like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and the boxing glove is gonna punch the roadrunner","yeah",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he’ll stop running",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so then he’s hiding behind the rock",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then um the road runner is about to pass",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so he tries to get the boxing glove to do that",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so then it doesn’t do what he wants",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and instead it goes backwards",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so the rock hits him ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","like somehow I don’t know how that happened but the rock hits him",NA,"like, I don't know",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then the boxing glove lets go",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and it goes backwards and hits him in the face ?",NA,NA,"?","6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so then that’s another one that he missed",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then um so he comes up with a new plan",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","like in front of him with his plans of what’s gonna happen",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and you see that he",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","his plan is basically he’s gonna be standing on this like string",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","that connects both cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and um he’s gonna drop this huge metal box thing","mm-hmm","thing",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","on top of roadrunner when he passes by like down below",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and it’s gonna land on him and he’s gonna get him",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so that’s his plan in the paper so then he he sets it all up",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he takes the metal ton",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he star he’s about to walk with it on the string to go",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","into the middle so he can drop it on roadrunner","yeah",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then cause it’s so heavy",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","it takes him all the way down to where the roadrunner is","right",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so by the time he gets there the roadrunner is right in front of him",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he sees that he’s blocking his way",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so he just turns around and runs the other way ?","mm-hmm","just","?","6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then coyote um he gets frustrated again",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and drops the ton which is gonna make gravity go","yeah",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he flies up again",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then like he thinks he’s okay cause he has a backpack on his back",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then um it’s a case of parachute",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so he thinks he’s okay",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he pulls the string but it’s like disconnected",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then all you see is like the bag open",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and forks and knives and plates like start flying up",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so he didn’t have anything to save him","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then he takes an acme aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he’s and the pills start flying up",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he takes a bunch of then and I guess",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","’cause he knows he’s gonna be in pain or something",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so he lands on the floor",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then um oh and then he ends up trying to find roadrunner again",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he sees a place that says acme old acme mine or something ?",NA,"or something","?","6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","it’s like a coal mine","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he sees that roadrunner went in there",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so then you know it’s dark and everything and he realizes that",NA,"you know, and everything",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so he goes back and they have these you know like construction hats ?","yeah","you know, like","?","6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","the the hard ones",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and it has like a light on them so you can see where you’re going","mm-hmm","like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he has a greeeen one I think",NA,"I think",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","whatever one of them has a green one and one of them has a red one",NA,"whatever",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then so he sees that roadrunner went in there",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so he’s chasing roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","but it’s really hard to catch up with him because he’s so faast",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and you know they’re chasing each other around the place",NA,"you know",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","but you just see like you just see like darkness kind of",NA,"just, just, like, kind of",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and like the lights running after each other",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","like you don’t actually see them running after each other","yeah","like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so then um he ends up going the wrong way basically",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","roadrunner goes another way and he goes the wrong way by mistake",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and and he’s running and running",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then he realizes that I guess his light went out",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and he doesn’t see anything",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so he lights a match to see where he’s at",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and behind him all you see is um like",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","TNT boxes dynamite and all that","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","so everything gets so blown he ahk",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","he ends up getting blown up",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and then you just see a sign made with cactuses that says YIPE",NA,"just",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","or something like that","mm-hmm","or something",NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,1,1,"New","and that’s the end","okay",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
6,2,2,"New","alright so this is a roadrunner and coyote cartoon","okay",NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","soo you see",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","it opens where you see the desert and the road",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and then um roadrunner is running in front of coyote",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and coyote is trying to catch the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","aand he’s running faster and faster trying to catch up to him",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and in his hands he has a knife and a fork",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","’cause he’s gonna try to stab him with the knife and the fork",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","to stab him and eat him or whatever",NA,"or whatever",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","but right like he jumps to grab him but he misses",NA,"like",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and he ends up grabbing the floor instead ? with the knife and the fork",NA,NA,"?","6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and the roadrunner keeps on running",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and he’s frustrated",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","but then he gets an idea",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","while he’s laying on the floor with the knife and the fork",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so then he has this idea where he t takes",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","there’s like this big rock like hidden from the road",NA,"like",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so that roadrunner won’t see",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and a metal like like a metal ring he puts around it ?",NA,"like, like","?","6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","where he attaches boxing glove with a spring ?",NA,NA,"?","6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so he’s gonna",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","the boxing glove will be held back until the roadrunner comes",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and it’ll punch him and then he’ll be you know on the floor again",NA,"you know",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so then that’s his plan",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","he’s standing behind it",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","somehow when he tries to let the boxing glove go",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","instead of doing what he planned",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","um the rock somehow hits him ? like he gets crashed by the rock ?",NA,"like","?, ?","6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","like the rock goes backwards ?",NA,"like","?, ?","6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and then um the boxing glove instead of shooting frontwards",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","it shoots backwards so it hits him in the face ?",NA,NA,"?","6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so he’s frustrated again",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so then he comes up with a new plan um",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and you see him with like a paper like a plan of everything",NA,"like, like",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and you see on the paper it it shows a picture of two cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and it shows him standing in the middle",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and the he dropped this metal ton on roadrunner on the bottom",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","’cause he’s on the bottom road ?",NA,NA,"?","6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so that’s his plan",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","like he’s gonna make a string ? I guess it’s like a string basically",NA,"I guess, like","?","6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","he’s gonna walk on the string and drop the metal ton on roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and he’ll be like you know down",NA,"you know",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so then you see him actually do it",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","but he doesn’t realize that it’s not gonna work",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","because then he takes the metal ton",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and he’s he’s about to start walking on the the metal on the string",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","that connects both cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and once he starts walking on it it brings him down",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","’cause of gravity ’cause it’s so heavy",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and he ends up being on the floor",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and right when he gets down the roadrunner is about to pass",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so then roadrunner sees that he’s in his way",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so he turns around and starts running the other way instead",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so then he’s frustrated again",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and then he drops the ton ’cause he thinks he’s gonna get off the string",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","but gravity takes him back up",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and he shoots up into the sky",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","but then he thinks he’s okay because he has this book bag on",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and he takes out a string I guess ’cause he thinks he has a parachute",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","but it turns out the string doesn’t work",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and all that you see is is stuff flying up in the air",NA,"stuff",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","like forks and knifes and plates and stuff like that",NA,"like, stuff like that",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and then he sees that he’s gonna go down",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so he takes out his acme aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and the pills start flying up",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","but he manages to get a few I guess",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","because he knows he’s gonna be in pain",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and then he lands on the floor",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and then um he tries to go look for roadrunner again",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and he sees a a sign that says old old uh acme mine ?",NA,NA,"?","6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","or something like that",NA,"or something like that",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so it’s like a coal mine",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and roadrunner is in there",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so then he starts to go in to chase him but then it’s completely dark",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so he gets scared and he goes back out",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and they have like a s a shelf with the caps you know",NA,"like, you know",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","like the hardware hats the hard ones ?",NA,"like","?","6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and then um it has lights on them so you can see ahead of you",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so he takes one and roadrunner ends up having one too",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and one of them have green and one of them have red",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so they’re chasing each other around the mine",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and you just see like the lights",NA,"like",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","you don’t actually see them ‘cause it’s dark",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","but it’s hard for um coyote to keep up",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so then um he’s chasing him and he ends up going the wrong way",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","like roadrunner went the other way ?",NA,"like","?","6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and he’s running",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and his light I guess went out ‘cause it’s dark",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and then he lights a match to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and all you see is like dynamite and TNT boxes in the back there",NA,"like",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","so then he ends up getting blown up I guess",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","‘cause then you just hear the sound",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and you see the signs made with the cactuses outside that says YIPE","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,2,2,"New","and that’s the end","nice",NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
6,3,1,"Old","okay so this is a coyote roadrunner cartoon",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and it opens with the desert",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and you see roadrunner ahead of coyote running really fast",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","aand um coyote is um chasing him",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he has a knife and a fork in his hands",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he’s trying to get roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and finally um he gets closer to him",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so he makes a leap like to stab him with the knife and the fork",NA,"like",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so he can eat him",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and then he misses",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so he stabs the floor instead",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and then c roadrunner keeps on running",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so he’s frustrated",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he’s laying on the floor with the fork and the knife",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","but then he has this new idea",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so then you see this large rock",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","that’s like hidden from where roadrunner could see when he passes by",NA,"like",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he has he puts like a metal ring around it",NA,"like",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and a uh boxing glove which he attaches with a spring",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so that the boxing glove is going to you know punch roadrunner",NA,"you know",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","as he um runs by",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so and that’s his plan",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","but somehow when roadrunner is about to pass",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","the rock ends up like hitting him instead ?",NA,NA,"?","6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","like it backs up into him somehow ?","mm-hmm","like","?","6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","when I guess from the release of the boxing glove",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and the boxing glove ends up hitting him",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","instead it goes backwards instead of frontwards",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","soo you know that’s once again a failure",NA,"you know",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so then he has a new plan",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","where you see him with like a plan actually planned out on paper",NA,"like",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and you see that basically is gonna drop a metal ton below him",NA,"basically",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","’cause he’s gonna be in the middle of two cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","standing on a string ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he’s gonna drop a metal t ton below him that’s gonna run the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he’ll be able to get him like that",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so then when he actually does it",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","what he doesn’t realize is that gravity ’cause then um",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","he takes the metal ton",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he’s about to walk on um the string",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and as he starts walking on it",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","it brings him all the way back down to where roadrunner is",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and by the time he’s down the roadrunner is right in front of him",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he sees that coyote’s blocking his way",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so he turns around and goes the other way",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so then coyote gets frustrated again",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he drops the ton on the floor",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and then he ends up shooting back up into the sky",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and then",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","but he thinks he’s okay because he thinks he has a parachute",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he pulls the string",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","but there it doesn’t work and then all you see is like his plates",NA,"like",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and forks and knifes and all this stuff flying out of the bag",NA,"and all this stuff",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","up into the sky",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so then he realizes he’s gonna go down",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so he takes acme aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he opens it",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he tries to take pills as they’re flying up into the sky",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he takes a little bit",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and then he falls on the ground",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and then hee he’s he’s trying to find roadrunner again",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he sees the old acme mine ?",NA,NA,"?","6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and that’s where roadrunner is at",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so he goes in and he’s trying to find him but it’s dark",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so then he goes back out and there’s like a shelf at the front entrance",NA,"like",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","that has the hardware hats ? with the lights in front of them so he can see ?",NA,NA,"?, ?","6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so then he tries to find roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and he’s chasing him and he’s chasing him",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","he can’t really keep up",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and then he ends up going the wrong way",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and um he can’t see where he’s at",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","’cause his light went out or something ?",NA,"or something","?","6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","soo he takes a match and lights it to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and all you see behind him is",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","the TNT and dynamite boxes and all that crazy stuff",NA,"all that crazy stuff",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","so then um he ends up getting blown up I guess",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","’cause then you hear the sound below the ground",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","and then just you see a sign with the cactuses",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","I thought it said YIPE but maybe it says YIKES",NA,"I thought, maybe",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","but it looked like YIPE to me","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
6,3,1,"Old","but that was it",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
7,1,1,"New","this is coyote and the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","which I’m sure you know",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","aand obviously the coyote was chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","with a fork and knife",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and wants to eat him",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","aand he wanted to stop the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","so he tries all these different tactics",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","aand hee put like a punching bags on a spring",NA,"like",NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","waited for it to like punch out off a rock",NA,"like",NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and hit the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","but it didn’t work",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","the rock ended up pushing back",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","aand the spring punched him in the face",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and theen um",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","he tried another thing",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","like he went on a tightrope on top of a cliff",NA,"like",NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and then used a weight",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and the weight pushed him all the way to the ground",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","he thought he was gonna drop it on the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","but the roadrunner uhr stopped",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and didn’t didn’t drop it on him",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and he ended up flinging into the air",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and he thought he had a parachute",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","he didn’t have a parachute",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","he had um nothing really",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","the bag had like aspirin",NA,"like",NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","he took an aspirin I guess for the fall",NA,"I guess",NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and then hee fell or whatever",NA,"or whatever",NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and then he tried again",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","they he followed the roadrunner into a cave",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","aand he had like the cap with the headlights on or whatever",NA,"like, or whatever",NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and run in the cave",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and they’re just chasing each other around for a while",NA,"just",NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and then he",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","the roadrunner went a different way in the cave than him",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and he ended up going into like a whole thing of uh TNT",NA,"like, thing",NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","aand he ended up getting blown up I guess",NA,"I guess",NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,1,1,"New","and that was it",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
7,2,1,"Old","well the road the road ch uh",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","coyote was chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","and  he’s chasing him with a fork and knife",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","and then he wants too find out a way to stop the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","and I guess to eat him",NA,"I guess",NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","and he put thee punching bag on a spring",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","and the spring on a rock",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","and the rock was gonna",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","have the punching bag hit the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","but ended up punching him",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","the rock 1-syll pushed back and punched him in the face",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","aand he tried another tactic",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","by going on a tightro uh",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","like a rope on top of two cliffs",NA,"like",NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","with a weight",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","and the weight ended up pushing him to the ground",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","he flung in the air",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","and he thought he had a parachute",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","but he didn’t",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","he ended up taking aspirin for the fall",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","aand that was it",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","and then he ended up following the roadrunner into a cave",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","and he had the headlights on",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","and just chasing each other around for a while",NA,"just",NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","aand he ended up going to a mound of TNT",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","and he ended up blown up I guess",NA,"I guess",NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,2,1,"Old","underneath the ground",NA,NA,NA,"7-2-1-Old"
7,3,2,"New","it was the coyote and the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-3-2-New"
7,3,2,"New","aand um obviously the coyote is chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-3-2-New"
7,3,2,"New","with a fork and knife",NA,NA,NA,"7-3-2-New"
7,3,2,"New","he wanted to like eat him",NA,"like",NA,"7-3-2-New"
7,3,2,"New","aand um in order to stop the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-3-2-New"
7,3,2,"New","he tried a bunch of different tacticsthe first one was",NA,NA,NA,"7-3-2-New"
7,3,2,"New","to put a punching bag on a spring",NA,NA,NA,"7-3-2-New"
7,3,2,"New","tied to a rock",NA,NA,NA,"7-3-2-New"
7,3,2,"New","so it would like punch him",NA,"like",NA,"7-3-2-New"
7,3,2,"New","punch the roadrunner I guess while he was running",NA,"I guess",NA,"7-3-2-New"
7,3,2,"New","but it ended up not working",NA,NA,NA,"7-3-2-New"
7,3,2,"New","aand the rock got pushed back into him",NA,NA,NA,"7-3-2-New"
7,3,2,"New","and the punching bag hit him in the face",NA,NA,NA,"7-3-2-New"
7,3,2,"New","and then he tried another thing",NA,NA,NA,"7-3-2-New"

8,1,1,"New","and it will knock the roadrunner out","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"8-1-1-New"
8,1,1,"New","but theen it backfires on him",NA,NA,NA,"8-1-1-New"

8,1,1,"New","and then suspend the anvil ?",NA,NA,"?","8-1-1-New"
8,1,1,"New","so that the roadrunner will like hit into it ?",NA,"like","?","8-1-1-New"
8,1,1,"New","but then he ends up walking across the tightrope with the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"8-1-1-New"
8,1,1,"New","but then the rope falls like","on him","like",NA,"8-1-1-New"
8,1,1,"New","like he walks to the middle of it",NA,"like",NA,"8-1-1-New"
8,1,1,"New","and he’s the the rope is weighted down by the anvil","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"8-1-1-New"
8,1,1,"New","and then the roadrunner comes",NA,NA,NA,"8-1-1-New"
8,1,1,"New","and passes him by again",NA,NA,NA,"8-1-1-New"
8,1,1,"New","and then um what happens after that ?",NA,"what happens after that","?","8-1-1-New"

8,1,1,"New","aand the roadrunner keeps passing him by taunting him",NA,NA,NA,"8-1-1-New"
8,1,1,"New","and then finally the roadrunner runs away from him",NA,NA,NA,"8-1-1-New"
8,1,1,"New","and the coyote ends up in a really dark cave",NA,NA,NA,"8-1-1-New"
8,1,1,"New","and he lights a match to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"8-1-1-New"

8,2,1,"Old","okay um it starts off with the roadrunner and coyote story",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and the coyote wants to eat the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","so he’s chasing him with a fork and a knife in his hand",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","but he can’t catch him",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"

8,2,1,"Old","to eat him",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and the first plan he comes up with is",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","with a boxing glove attached to a spring",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and he’s hiding behind a rock",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and he’s gonna let go of the spring",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and it’s gonna knock the roadrunner out",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","the roadrunner comes by",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"

8,2,1,"Old","and the boxing glove punches him",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and then the second plan is",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","to suspend an anvil from two cliffs on a tightrope ?",NA,NA,"?","8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and the roadrunner walks to the middle of the the tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","with the anvil and",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","but the rope is weighted down by the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","so he falls to the ground the roadrunner comes by",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","ing towards him and leaves",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and then uh he’s like he lets go of the anvil",NA,"like",NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and he’s thrown up into the air",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and he falls back down",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and he he I guess he has a headache or something",NA,"I guess, or something",NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and then uh the third one is when",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","they’re both in the mines",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and the it’s really dark inside",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","they’re like caves",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and they’re chasing each other around",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","the roadrunner keeps uh taunting him",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and they keep just running around in circles",NA,"just",NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and theen um the roadrunner kinda goes away",NA,"kinda",NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and the coyote is left in a dark room",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","so he lights a match and to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and he’s in a room full of TNT",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,2,1,"Old","and he blows up","okay",NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
8,3,2,"New","okay um it’s the coyote and roadrunner story ?","yeah",NA,"?","8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and it starts off with a desert scene",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and the coyote is chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","with a fork and a knife",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","’cause he wants to eat him",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and then he can’t catch the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","so he tries to come up with a plan ?",NA,NA,"?","8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","aand his first plan is",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","to attach a boxing glove to a spring",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and then when the roadrunner passes by",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","he’s gonna let go of the spring",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and the boxing glove is gonna knock the roadrunner out",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and the roadrunner comes by",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and he lets go of the spring",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","but it the thing it eventually backfires on him",NA,"thing",NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and he actually like gets thrown into the cliff backwards ?",NA,"like","?","8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and the boxing glove punches him",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and the second plan is",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","to suspend a tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and like hang an anvil from it ?",NA,"like","?","8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","so that when the roadrunner comes by he’s gonna hit into it",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","so he walks across the tightrope with the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","but then the rope is weighted down by the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","so he he falls down",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and the roadrunner comes by and taunts him",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and goes away",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and and uh thee coyote becomes frustrated",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","he lets go of the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and he gets like thrown into the air ?","mm-hmm","like","?","8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and then he comes back down and hits the ground",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and then the third plan is",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","to uh go into the mines and catch him there",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","’cause it’s really dark","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","soo they both go into the mines",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and they’re both chasing around each other in circles",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and and the roadrunner I mean",NA,"I mean",NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","the coyote can’t catch up with the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and then uh basically they chase each other around",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and the roadrunner keeps taunting him",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","the roadrunner goes away",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and then the coyote is left in a dark room",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and he lights a match to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and there’s TNT all behind him",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
8,3,2,"New","and he gets blown up",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
9,1,1,"New","uh basically I was watching the roadrunner and the coyote cartoon ?","oh okay","basically","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","alright so it starts off first where uh the what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","the roadrunner is running ?",NA,NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and the like the coyote is chasing her",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and then underneath they’re saying how the roadrunner is really really fast","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and how the coyote is like really really hungry",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so like carnivorus and and accelerator or whatever for the roadrunner","yeah","like, or whatever",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he’s like wearing like a bib and has like a knife and a fork ?",NA,"like, like, like","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and is basically chasing her",NA,"basically",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and like all of a sudden like he he puts his fork and knife in",NA,"like, like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","like he tries to stick into her but what’s it into the roadrunner ?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","but it ends up hitting the ground right ?",NA,NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and the roadrunner runs away",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so then he’s saying he’s like gone all sad and stuff you know ?","yeah","like, and stuff, you know","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and then he’s like oh I have an idea",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so it goes to the next scene basically",NA,"basically",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","where he’s trying to do one of his",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","like what’s it called traps or whatever?",NA,"like, what's it called, or whatever","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so basically he takes a rock right?",NA,"basically, right","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he around the rock he attaches a spring",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and at the end of the spring there’s like a a punching glove ?","mm-hmm","like","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so he thinks that if he takes the spring",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","he takes the what’s it called the punching uh the punching glove ?",NA,"what's it called","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and pulls the spring back",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","connects it to the rock",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","then when he pulls it on the string right",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","when the coyote comes","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","like it’s gonna go that way ?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and what is it and like hit the coyote right?","okay","like","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","’cause it’s like a big",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","like is in a canyon is like a big space over here","yeah","like, like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so what happens is that the roadrunner is coming",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he lets go",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","but instead of the spring going forward",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","the spring pushes the rock back into him ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he gets crashed into a wall or whatever with the rock ?",NA,"or whatever","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and then after that the what’s it called the glove comes back",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and it sta and it punches him in the face",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so that doesn’t work",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so then he’s looking at another plan",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","like where he like where he takes a rope",NA,"like, like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he goes over a canyon above the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so the coyote’s like underneath at the bottom of the canyon",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he has like two rocks",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and there’s like a string there",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he’s supposed to basically like",NA,"basically, like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","walk into the middle of the string",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","with an anvil or whatever",NA,"or whatever",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","the acme ?","yeah",NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","the acme anvils",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and when the when the",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","the purpose is basically that when the roadrunner",NA,"basically",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","I mean yeah the roadrunner when he comes",NA,"I mean",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","he’s gonna drop it on her",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","aand he’s like whatever she’s gonna be dead right?",NA,"like, whatever","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","when he starts walking down with the anvil like on the rope",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","it goes down all the way",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","because it’s so heavy","oh yeah",NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","right?",NA,NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and then what’s it called and then the roadrunner comes",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and she’s like MEEP MEEP you knowor whatever",NA,"like, you know, or whatever",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he gets frustrated",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he throws it away",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and all of a sudden the rope goes up",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he’s like flying in the air",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he’s like oh I’m gonna die now",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he’s like wait a minute",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","I’m he was wearing a parachute right?",NA,NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so he’s like see I’m smart",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he like opens the parachute",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and nothing comes out of it",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","justlikewhat’s it calledlike kitchen supplies I guess ?",NA,"just, like, what's it called, like, I guess","?","9-1-1-New"

9,1,1,"New","and starts taking it so whatev so that um",NA,"whatev",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so he doesn’t have a headache",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so then he starts what is it?",NA,"what is it?",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","it cuts to a scene where",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","he’s chasing the roadrunner into a mine ?",NA,NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","or whatever ?",NA,"or whatever","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","basically like a mining area ?",NA,"basically, like","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he chases her in there",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he can’t see anything",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","he needs like a mining hat with like the little",NA,"like, like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","what’s it called the little like flashlight","oh flashlight","what's it called, like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","yeah with the flashlight on top",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","he uh he’s chasing her into the so he’s",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","what is it ?",NA,"what is it","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","he gets one of those hats",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so he starts chasing her",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and originally like the the mine is set up like this",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","it has like a",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","like it’s a square",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and then there are two things going out this way I think",NA,"I think",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and like one like that ?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so basically he’s chasing her",NA,"basically",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and they start going around like this one thing","mm-hmm","like, thing",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","like this",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and like it starts off slow ?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and then it goes faster and faster and faster and faster",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so fast that the roadrunner gets a chance to go this way ?","uh-huh",NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","a different path",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he’s still going like in circles like chasing her",NA,"like, like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and then he realizes that she’s not there",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so he starts chasing her this way",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and then what’s it called the mine cuts into differently",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","it goes like thiis and like a zigzag ?","uh-huh","like","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","but then like the zigzag starts off wide ?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and like long?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and then it gets smaller so it’s like this",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so he go like the roadrunner goes one way again",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he goes a different way like straight",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","she goes like up ?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he’s still going like this",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","because he’s so used to this motion ?","yeah",NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and so to the point where he he gets to the end of the",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","what’s it called um",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","the end of the",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","he ha he gets to the end of the mine ?",NA,NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and he’s sitting there and it’s pitch black dark",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","he doesn’t know what’s going on",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so he lights a match to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and it turns out that there’s all these explosives around him ?","of course",NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so it just blows up the mine",NA,"just",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and on at the outside it shows the trees going to YIPES or whatever",NA,"or whatever",NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","so the word YIPES",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,1,1,"New","and then it ends so","huh nice",NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
9,2,2,"New","okay so basically",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","I was watching the roadrunner and the coyote ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","cartoon the looney tunes one",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so it starts off with the roadrunner is",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","I mean the coyote is chasing the roadrunner ?",NA,"I mean","?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he has like a bib on with a what’s it called",NA,"like, what's it called",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","with a knife and a fork in both hands","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he’s like chasing after her ?",NA,"like","?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and underneath the roadrunner it like states like a caption",NA,"like, like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so it’s like accelerati",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","I don’t I don’t know which language it was in buut",NA,"I don't know",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","it basically said that she was fast ?",NA,NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and then the coyota",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","the coyote they basically said that it was like hungry",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","it was carnivore ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so he’s like chasing her",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he tries sticking his like knife and fork into her",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","but the coyote’s too fast",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so he just hits the floor",NA,"just",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so he’s like all upset",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","he’s like you know",NA,"like, you know",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he sits down he’s like thinking",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","he’s like oh I have an idea",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so he goes to the next uh to his next plan",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","where basically",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","’cause they’re like at a canyon ?",NA,"like","?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so what happens is that",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","he sits on the side of the canyon",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","he thinks that once the roadrunner passes him",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","like he ha he sets up this contraption basically",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","which is a roock and it has like a spring connected to it ?",NA,"like","?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and the spring",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","the end of the spring is connected to a punching glove",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so he pulls back the spring",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and connects it to the rock",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he thinks that when he pulls the what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","those the string",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","that it’s gonna let go of the spring",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and the and like the glove is gonna hit the",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","the roadrunner really really fast",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so what happens is that he’s sitting there",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he’s waiting for the roadrunner to come",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he pulls the string",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and instead of the glove going forward",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","it pushes the rock back",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and it squishes him into the",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","what’s it called into whatever wall is behind him ?",NA,"what's it called","?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and then on top of that then like um",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","the glove comes back and hits him also",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so like instead of moving forward it goes back",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so whatever",NA,"so whatever",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so he goes to the sec to his third plan",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","or second plan",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","aand basically this one is where",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","he decides that he’s gonna put a a string",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","across on top of the what’s it called um",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","on top of the canyon ?",NA,NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he puts a string there",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he’s gonna walk to the middle of the string",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","with a with with an anvil ?",NA,NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he was gonna drop it down the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","the what’s it called the roadrunner",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","when she passes",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so he takes a what is it ?",NA,"what is it?",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so he takes the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he starts walking on this rope",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","but he’s so heavy",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","that it goes all the way down",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","like it pu it goes aall the way down",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so he’s on the floor uh on the road",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and all of a sudden thee what is it ?",NA,"what is it","?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","the roadrunner rolls up",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and she’s like",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","she looks at him and gives him a like MEEP MEEP",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","like a zz a teaser or whatever you know?",NA,"like, or whatever, you know","?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he throws the cannon I mean not the cannon",NA,"I mean",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","the anvil to the side ?",NA,NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and it automatically the rope",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","like it springs him up into the air",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he’s like oh I’m smart",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","he’s it shows that he’s wearing a parachute right?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so when he tries to open the parachute ?",NA,NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","nothing comes out just like like kitchen supplies",NA,"just, like, like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and stuff like I don’t know food or",NA,"and stuff, like, I don't know",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","I don’t remember what was in there",NA,"I don't remember",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so he’s like oh shite",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","he’s like he takes acme aspirin ?",NA,"like","?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","’cause he knows it’s gonna hurt","yeah",NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so then he you like",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","it cuts to the scene where",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","he’s basically chasing her into a uh mine?",NA,NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","like a mining area or whatever ?",NA,"like, or whatever","?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and the mine is set up that",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","it’s like",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","a square like this ? at first",NA,NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and it has like two separations coming out of it",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and like one on top but",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so he basically starts chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","like on that thing over here",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so it starts off slow like this ?",NA,NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and then it goes faster and faster and faster",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so at one point they’re going in circles ?",NA,NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and they’re going so fast that the",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","roadrunner gets a chance to escape into a different tunnel ?",NA,NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he’s still going in circles like this",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and then realizes that she’s not there",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","he starts chasing her",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","then it cuts to it goes into like thiis",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","then it goes into a zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","like uh a zigzag mine",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","it starts off really long like this like saw",NA,"like, like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and cuts smaller into smaller into smaller",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","so basically he’s going like this and he’s going like this",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","right ?",NA,NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and then the mine cuts into one up and one straight",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","the roadrunner goes up",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","he goes straight but he’s still going like this",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","because so he’s so used to the movement ?",NA,NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and he’s like",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","basically he ends up somewhere where he doesn’t know where he is",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","it’s pitch black dark",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","aand he’s like he lights a match",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and all of a sudden he sees that there’s explosives there",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","andwhat’s it called and he like blows up basically?",NA,"what's it called, like","?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","because he lit a match ?",NA,NA,"?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and on the outside of the mine it said like YIPES ?",NA,"like","?","9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","the trees go into like a YIPES thing",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,2,2,"New","and that’s it",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
9,3,1,"Old","alright",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","um yeah I was watching thee looney tunes cartoon",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","with the roadrunner and the um the coyote","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","so it starts off where thee coyote is chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and the roadrunner is like what’s it called",NA,"like, what's it called",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","is really really fast",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","so they say accelerator or whatever underneath",NA,"or whatever",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","so they’re basically saying it’s fast",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and the coyote is hungry",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","so they’re like carnivoris or whatever",NA,"like, or whatever",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and the coyote is wearing like a bib",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and he’s holding like a knife and a fork",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and chasing after this like poor roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and what’s it calledlike yeah",NA,"what's it called, like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","he tries to stick his fork and knife into the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","but the roadrunner was so fast that",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","he like ch he like ends up hitting the floor",NA,"like, like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","I mean the road street I don’t know",NA,"I don't know",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","anyways",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","soo uh he’s like yeah",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","so then he’s like all upset and stuff like that",NA,"like, and stuff like that",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","so he’s like thinking and thinking",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and he’s like oh I have an idea you know ?",NA,"like, you know","?","9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","so the next thing that he tries to do is like",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","he has this idea where",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","he basically takes a rock",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and he hooks up a spring to it",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and the spring at the end of uh",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","the end of the spring is connected to uh a glove",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","which is like a punching glove",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","so he pulls back the spring ?",NA,NA,"?","9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and hooks it onto the what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","onto the rock or whatever",NA,"or whatever",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","so that when he",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","so that when he pulls the string like",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","it’s supposed to go forward and hit like the roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","as she’s passing the canyon",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","so what happens is that he’s sitting there and waiting",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and the roadrunner comes",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and he pulls the string",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","but instead of going forwards ?",NA,NA,"?","9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","the the spring pushes the rock back",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and squishes the coyote in the middle of the like",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","the wall and the rock",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and then after that like uh the spring flies back",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and the f glove hits him in the face",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","so so that didn’t work",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","so then the second plan is that basically",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","he’s gonna put a string above the canyon",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","where he’s gonna tightrope walk into the middle",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and he’s supposed to be holding an anvil ?",NA,NA,"?","9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","and drop it down on the what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","on the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","when she’s passing by",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
9,3,1,"Old","but when he starts walking out onto thee string ?",NA,NA,"?","9-3-1-Old"
